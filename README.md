# NFERNO-POKER an Agile Planning Tool

## About

This project was stared by the Duluth MN, .NET user group as a shared skills building effort.
NFERNO-POKER is agile planning poker, designed so that participants can read, research and point user stories in isolation. This leads to a faster more efficient pointing meeting. Instead of waiting for team members to read and point the story, the scrum master can facilitate meaningful discussion to keep game times down.

## Getting Started

Navigate to

> src/nfernopoker/ClientApp

Within the ClientApp folder:

    npm install
    npm run start

This will start a dev server and open the application. The main application functionality will work without the .Net Core app being ran. Currently, the .Net Core application only hosts the JIRA API.
